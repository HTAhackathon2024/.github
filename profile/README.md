Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is the GitHub Organisation for the *R in HTA Hackathon* 5th - 6th August 2024!

This will be a 2 day event at Queen's University Belfast, Ireland for health economists, statisticians and R users.

### Overview

* Are you interested in using the power of R programming to tackle problems in health economics?
* Do you want to join up with a community of like-minded people?
* This will involve small group project work developing novel health economics tools, as well as training in related data science skills.


### Challenge themes

To help with development and selection, the tackled problems will fit within five broad challenge areas. These are:

-   Reproducibility in HTA
-   Reading, cleaning, and storing HTA data
-   Reporting HTA results
-   HTA model robustness
-   HTA functionality and workflows
